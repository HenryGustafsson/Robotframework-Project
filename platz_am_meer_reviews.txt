A clean decent mall, with very friendly staff. Lovely views of the ocean.

Just a few anchor shops under one roof. Nothing special.

Platz Am Meer is a modern, clean and well-maintained shopping center with a variety of stores and restaurants. It has a nice play area for kids outside and offers some ocean views as well. However, it is located quite far from the tourist ‚Ä¶

Used to be great‚Ä¶The once-bustling shopping mall now echoes with the remnants of its former vibrancy, as anchor tenants gradually abandon their spaces, leaving behind a shell of unfulfilled potential. Stores that once showcased trendy ‚Ä¶

Not much to do here and not so much shops. Very beautifull location. But a time waste driving there. Best place there is Blue grass restuarant

Clean. Lots of parking. Quite a few shops. Beautiful view on the old harbour/ocean. Nice restaurants. Friendly staff in stores. Good prices.

Stunning mall with beautiful see views and great restaurants. Two ocean front paddle courts is the cherry on the cake.

I took one star off because the wifi doesn't work, kept getting network security issues.  Other than that nice mall, great mix of stores and places to eat.
---
I absolutely love this little mall. All of the necessary stores are there, like Checkers, Clicks, Truworths and cellphone shops. We ended our shopping day at Mugg & Bean which was absolutely fantastic. The views from the restaurant are ‚Ä¶
---
All shops in the mall are fine except, Checkers is selling  rotten fruits and vegetables.  Their apples are  rotten, sweet potatoes are rotten.  Be very careful on the fruit and vegetables section.
---
We always go here when in Swakopmund: all the shops you need and ample parking!
---
A nice shopping centre to visit. It is a pity that we can only visit it once every 2 years when we are in Namibia for holiday.

Good place to shopping in Swakopmund. Easy to park and there are several shops to prepare safari.

It is a kinda big mall but doesn't have all the shops that you need.

Beautiful sunsets, although rare in winter, and wonderful restaurants to eat at with great food and some having better service than others

Do not like the lay out. Parking is a problem for bigger cars. Wants to be Cape Town Waterfront it seems

I love going to shops here, or even the restaurants. The little play grounds are nice for kids, while parents can watch them play.
The cleanest public toilets are near the Checkers Liquor store, the others are ‚Ä¶

See how we are enjoying our self at platz Am Meer mall me and my fiance to be........

We didn't Like the Shops in this mall
---
It's a nice and clean place, easy access to stores and exits.
---
We had lunch at Blue Grass Restaurant and on our way out, my daughter wanted to go down the mall's slide. She only went on it once, and on her way down, the rusted sides of the slide cut open her toe very very badly. We had to rush her to a doctor.
---
Nice new Mall. Doing great.
---
The mall is ok,not my favourite place to go shopping, it has a few great places to get something to eat and drink, it is not a well thought out mall but has a few shops worth visiting. The facility and bathrooms are very clean and neat.
---
Good experience... some clothing stores and fast food outlets close to sea and beach... very scenic... Your average shopping mall, nothing special except for the beautiful ocean view just outside the doors...

Family fun for young and old. One of the few places which are actually open on a public holiday.

Shopping at your convenience. Get all your necesssities within walking distance from each other. Great coffee shops and an awesome view of the ocean.

The mall is beautifully constructed right next to the ocean. There is a variety of shops where you can buy. They also have an arcade where you can take your children an a mini playground outside.. The atmosphere is fantastic l. There is also security presence.

Good all-round mall, entertaining whatever needs you have, for young and young at heart visitors.
General setup very user-friendly and convenient. ‚Ä¶

Cute little sea side mall. Only visited the mtc store. Frienly service. Clean environment

Nifty shopping mall with the necessities. Last time I was in this town the mall wasn't even around. I love the view of the ocean. They really made an effort to take advantage of that feature. I love that we can bring our dogs here. Not many ‚Ä¶

Its a large and spacious mall with a great atmosphere and large variety of shops. You can find anything you need from food to clothes and books. It has a great outdoor area with a beautiful view of the Atlantic ocean and even a play area for kids. Truly beautifully built.
---
Got wat I needed. Family friendly. Lots of shops to choose from and at last Jet Home is Open, MRP Home is also Open. Great combination.
---
Delightful mall. Everything well cared for and location magnificent. Maybe a little sign posting would help one find the place.
---
How to go about rating an entire mall experience? if you're prone to people walking around mindlessly about, this would be a 5-star rating. If you're a closet-introvert, just avoid all-round specials days.
---
Quite a nice shopping center, has all the usual outlets and a nice big Checkers. It is missing out on the popular Woolworths though. From fast food and restaurants to the waterfront out front, it is a convenient place to spend an hour or ‚Ä¶

Platz Am Meer is our one stop center and shopping complex. Customers safety are  first priority of customers.
Shops are selling affordable products.
Shop owners and staff are very friendly and helpful.

Good selection of in season top quality, fresh fruit and vegetables. Well stocked butchery, bakery and dairy sections, while the in-store sushi station and breakfast counters make it great shopping experience.

Visit the Mall in Swakopmund to have some fam time....
---
Well situated mall complex that caters for all your needs from shopping, clothing, restaurants, medical etc. Enough parking

I like this mall for various reasons. It is not too big but it is big enough that you should find anything you need. It has a lot of fast food restaurants and restaurants bordering the oceanside which makes it nice to eat there at a nice day after shopping.
---
This a very beautiful Mall, the design and aesthetics are marvellous. Easy access to all floors either by passenger lifts, escalators or stairs. Ample parking is available on two floors and the private apartments offer a beautiful scenery ‚Ä¶
---
Very neat mall but unfortunately they don't have any baby changing facilities that I could find, and if there are, they weren't easily accessible.
---
The shopping center is very nice. You can get just about everything you need.  If you want a perfect meal go to Truth Cafe.  Bring your friends and enjoy a perfect coffee.
---
Massive mall with everything you can think of. Outside is a huge collection of eating spot overlooking a breathtaking mini Harbour where everyone always take photos or pose for a few. Very well designed and managed. Another Namibian gem!
---
Clean and modest mall

Pretty new place, as I was told by my family. In fact everything is clean and new. The variety of shops is OK as you find most things you need for everyday life. ‚Ä¶

I love the new mall Set up and the view of the beach

Platz Am Meer is a rather characterless shopping mall with no water activities and just a dead walled off piece of water in front of the centre. There are a couple of good shops like DisChem and Aviary Coffee Shop and Blue Grass Restaurant. ‚Ä¶
---
A great shopping mall, too bad about the limited number of shops. It would be nice to have home ware and bedding shop other than Pep Home for example. But overall, i felt safe and free to shop around peacefully.

New modern mall with a residential component that gives it almost a holiday feel. Good selection and mix of chain tenants makes that I can see this as an good addition to the CDB businesses, where you'll hopefully always find the local ‚Ä¶

It's a mall..... that's about it, has mostly everything you need. Could do with some hardware shops and a bit more variety. ‚Ä¶

This mall has almost everything you need from clothing to groceries, camping equipment to banking, they have a few take always and restaurants with a beautiful few of the Atlantic ocean, there are two play grounds for the children and a day care play ground with arcade games for the bigger kids

Shop Managers from the Mall must go on customer care courses, they have no idea how to help customers or how to be friendly. The restaurants are extremely attentive and friendly staff.
---
Really liked the mall, was happy to see this mall. It's clean and has a nice vibe. Everything you might need under one roof. With friendly staff in each shop. Was a pleasant experience.

Only ever visit the Woolies for fresh produce!  Need better clothing shops /outfitters and a good Deli, to enhance the shopping experience.  Trenery, Witchery, Country Road, Poetry etcetera, would be very welcomed!

A modern mall with different shopping spots.

A lovely Centre with ample safe parking and has clean fresh toilets. Time to fill up all those empty shops though
---
Great shopping center at the beach front. Variety of stores both for shopping or grabbing a quick bite. Amazing seaside views from this site.
Abundancy of parking and this center to Swartkopmund and you can leave driving along the sea. One of the most calming shopping experience.

Seaside shopping experience. Child friendly.
---
New typical shopping center with an array of shops and restaurants to choose from.  You can enjoy a walk on the sea side of the mall with a beautiful view of the ocean.
---
The only proper shopping mall in Swakop. It's got pretty much every oind if shop one would require on a day to day basis: Dischem/Clicks, Checkers/Woolworths, clothing as well as smaller specialized stores. Food court and restaurants are decent as well.
---
Feels like I'm just somewhere else, the waterfront restaurants, the fresh sea breeze...it is really the perfect place to grab a bite and do some shopping! Plus, the parking is free!!!

Great place to shop, gather, eat, drink and explore. Great amount of shops. Excellent big friendly environment. Warm atmosphere. Beautifull view

Great atmosphere, great complex

Good mall with all you may need.
Checkers, Woolworths and Dischem.
There seems to be development and some activity on the jetty will hopefully be added in the near future.

Convenience is key and variety spices up anyone's life! Plate am Meer is fabulous

Still new so it has a few shops missing but overall it is really nice. It is like the Grove Mall in Windhoek but at the coast. Still needs a few more dining  places and a Ster-Kinekor.

Clean shops a variety of things that you need available, friendly and helpful staff. A great shopping experience üëç ‚Ä¶

The best mall ever, easy movements and cool weather, making shopping simply the best and easyüòä. ‚Ä¶

Really not much here unless you need a weekly shop at checkers or something from dischem...much easier to get what you need in swakop centre. If they had a cinema or some cool bars it would be worthwhile.

But the walk way is kind of small but its still nice. Enjoyed the place.

Good variety of shops, a bit of everything, however it's a smaller size mall.  the location by the seaside is great.

Very good to shop around not like other malls where you have to go looking around for shop  but i also think they must bring in a lot of shops like mr price at least
---
Variety of stores. Fully stocked. Restaurants. Good food. Ample parking. Security visible.

Have visited the shopping centre before. They have lost some outlets that were there at the start so don't expect all the stores to be filled. There are enough shops and restaurants to keep you busy.

A small mall on the seaside. One grocery store,a pharmacy,few clothing stores(Edgars and Woolworths included), some takeaway joints and upmarket restaurants and few other stores. Beautiful and clean facilities

Needs bigger Vuse stand

Dinning place, ideal dating place for couples.

Platz Am Meer shops are overpriced. Mugg & Bean in Platz Am Meer gives artificial cream with lemon in and calls it Sour cream. (The staff is adamant that the cream comes from a cow - feeling sick)

Nice mall.  I love sitting outside one of the coffee shops looking at the sea and people.
