The experience was so perfect in such a way that we ended up doing both camel riding and quad bike riding. The staff is extremely friendly and the place has proper facilities. I highly recommend

Richard was our guide for the 3 hour combo tour- I can‚Äôt say enough good things! He was amazing! Took us up and down dunes! He took great pictures and videos of us like were celebrities. Request him if you can and do the 3 hour combo tour! It‚Äôs the perfect amount of quad riding time and sandboarding time! You won‚Äôt regret it.

This was the highlight of my trip. I really had fun. The tram is very friendly and helpful. The guy made us feel comfortable and took us pictures so kind of him

Great place. Adventures start here for the kids and adults alike. Very accommodating to our young kids on the 4 wheelers, did the camel rides great experience.

We had a fantastic two hour quad bike drive across the dunes. We were taken on some exciting routes and stopped for a break on top of a massive dune overlooking Swakopmund. ‚Ä¶

I was a bit skeptical about doing the dune quad bike tour as I know most of the guides drive very slow.The guide was very friendly and asked us upfront if we know how to drive a quad bike.To my surprise we where driving nice and fast on,up ‚Ä¶

When we visited Desert Explorers, we didn't find any queues, however, people we know queued for about 30 minutes on busy days. I would highly recommend booking in advance. The tickets in my opinion were reasonable for the fun and service we ‚Ä¶

Activity was amazing! Want to give 5 stars. Really made me smile while crossing through the dunes. We were 2 people and one guide.
Afterwards the guide suggested us to leave a tip and said 200Nad was average.. I get that they try because we are tourists, but that doesn't feel good.
---
Lots of fun overall, and felt safe. Sand boarding is an absolute blast. Definitely wear sneakers or at least socks - the sand is hot!

Friendly and helpfull staff, quad bike tour in desert was great. Will do longer one next time, totally worth it!

We did the combo with two hours for quadding and one hour for dune lay down sledding. It was a great day! I love.that they send you out with a personalized guide. We were a pair and had our own guide which was awesome!n Philli was great!!

These guys know what they are doing.
Well organized!
Great activity for family ‚Ä¶

Plenty of activities to do while in Namibia. Check their website for prices so you plan properly to enjoy what they offer. Up to 10 min on busy days to buy ticket and to an hour for the activity
---
Absolutely enjoyed the experience and activities, the guides and instructors are friendly and helpful. I the only thing we didn‚Äôt like or enjoy it‚Äôs the bathrooms that are in the same space. There is no sense of privacy when one needs to change. With the camel ride it would be nice if they walked up to the dunes abit.

Had the best day of my life, though I fell from a quad bike üòÖüòÖ ‚Ä¶

I have visited here several time. Quad bike, and board and camel riding for my daughter. They are very professional. Programmes are well organised. But not recommend for sand boarding. It‚Äôs not shops fault. Just very hard to climb dunes for sliding lol

Amazing experience. My first time on a quad and dune surfing so it was great. We did the three hour combo of two hours on the quad and an hour surfing. The guide was very professional and made sure we had a good time.üòÅ They supply the boards too. Highly recommended ‚Ä¶

A great place to see the desert up close and personal.

Did camel riding and quad biking, both a lot of fun. Included a hotel pickup and drop off. Was super easy to book and no waiting on the day. Guides were good and we had a lot of fun. Thanks Marco and Bani.

I did both the camel ride and the quad bikes with my family of 4. The experience is awesome ,however, pertaining to the camel ride, it was cut significantly shorter. The reason is that it is season (festive season). I'm not happy about this ‚Ä¶

Interesting experience. 1 hour wait time because of so many riders on New year's day. ‚Ä¶

Wondeful 2-hour quad biking and sandboarding combo experience!
No need to book in advance for quad biking and sandboarding combo. Just pop in at their office, although you may need to wait because they were quite busy. ‚Ä¶

We booked the combo tour in advance (Quad & Dune surfing). We had SO much fun! Mono was our guide. He was very knowledgeable and fun. This is a must do activity when visiting Namibia, 100% worth it.

They charge 100 rand more if you are a single rider and go on a different tour than the person you came with. They tell you when you are about to pay and do not advertise this (false advertisement). The manager justifies it by saying ‚Äúevery ‚Ä¶

Made a reservation one day in advance to go with the quads to the dunes. At first it was slow but I think it was to test our skills and comfort level. Afterwards full speed through the dunes. Was awesome!

Great stuff from our guide! Lots of fun. Got nervous even though I‚Äôve ridden a quad bike since being a kid. Definitely get the longer duration. You won‚Äôt want to stop!

We just got back from our 2 hour ATV tour & wow what an exhilarating experience we had in the Namibian desert it‚Äôs was super fun riding around on the sand dunes some of them where huge. ‚Ä¶

We visited on the 8th of November 2024. I want to say we enjoyed a camel ride but, unfortunately they got new saddles and mine broke and I had to hang on for dear life. ‚Ä¶
---
If you visit Namibia, definitely go to Swakopmund and do quad biking! This is a rollercoaster on sand! 2 hours of pure adrenaline on an expansive, never ending sea of sand with swooping sand dunes waiting for you to ascend and descend. It's tons of fun! I did my quad biking tour with Desert Xplorers and thoroughly enjoyed it!
---
This was a lot more fun than I expected! Really enjoyed the quad biking through the scenic dunes. Our guide was very nice!

We took the quad-bike and sand boarding package, and it was an exhilarating experience, the guides are extremely helpful and friendly. If you want your adrenaline pumping do the sand boarding üëåüèæüëåüèæ ‚Ä¶

From the service to the experience was top tier.... Loved it. Would highly recommend.

So much fun and wonderful picture taking moments at an affordable prices. Both the camel ride and quadbiking were worth it. And great guides who make if easy for every type of person to ride

We did both the Quard bike and camel rides, we really enjoyed the experience,  however consider changing the camel saddles.

This was a beautiful experience on the overall. The camel ride was reasonable @ N$290 for 30mins on the dunes. You can go quad biking as well. It was well worth it üëåüèø ‚Ä¶

Quads were good fun,  1st time trying on sand dunes (not in mountains/ gravel), would definitely recommend! Edmund was great,  gave the more adventurous in the group opportunity to go up the higher dunes at faster pace. Also did go karts, track needs some improvement

The service is great, friends cashiers.  Camel ride is 350nad pp for 30mins. 15 mins in then you take pictures, I mean your guide will take you pics until you're tired of posing ü§£ another 15mins back.  In my humble opinion,  I think we ‚Ä¶

Was very windy and dusty the day we went, however the service was great, the ride was enjoyable even though the quadbikes were a little old and kept on cutting out at first. Major fun all in all. The guide was great and patient.

Supermario thanks! We had a blast with you!

Fantastic experience in the Namib desert. Guide was very knowledgeable and helpful. We did the 2 hour tour with sand boarding down a dune. Can definitely recommend!!
---
It was okay. We went on the camel ride but it was not far in, and to be honest not really value for money. The seat was pretty uncomfortable but to be expected. The staff were friendly so that's a plus. Best part for me was the 2 parrots you could hold.
---
Had an amazing time riding quads in the desert. Carlos was our guide and he was helpful, knew the places to take us and is one hell. Of a camera man! A must if your visiting swakopmond!
---
Quad biking here is loads of fun. Sand dunes are very interesting. The shapes formation are intriguing, I marvel at how they are formed just through wind movement, various patterns are visible in various locations, you can have a fantastic view of the bay and the desert from one of the higher peaks. Its a breathtaking scene

I've heard great reviews about this place but unfortunately I found about it on the last day of my trip in Swakopmund, so I just got pictures! However when I was passing by they were busy with the group quad biking lesson prior the 2 hour quad ride on the dunes! Which looks cool.

After a last minute trip to Swakopmund, desert explorers was an amazing way to make the most of my time there! The quad/sand boarding tour was extremely fun, and Ronald was an awesome guide.

We had a lot of fun, Mathew was super!

We did the quad and sand boarding combo. A great experience and well priced. Ben (our tour guide) was great. The quad ride was good fun and sand boarding quite exhilarating (it would have helped if I was not so unfit). I absolutely recommend.

We took 3hr COMBO - 1hr Lie-down Sandboarding and 2hr Quad Bike ride. That was absolutely amazing experience in desert and our first time to sandboarding. Combotrip was well organised, including pick-up and drop-off to hotel. ‚Ä¶

Absolutely unbeatable in the area. Great choice of fun around the stretch of sand south of Swakopmund. Kids love quad biking, camels and the two Parrots. The staff are helpful and accommodating.

Thanks to Devan, we enjoyed the ride a lot.
He showed us some of small fives, iron, and more. We extended our ride as it was really fun. ‚Ä¶

Great experience.  Gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because booking was challenging.  The team irregularly responded to emails over almost a month of my trying, and I ultimately had to call from out of country to nail down some dates. ‚Ä¶

We had a very nice and enjoyable experience with the quads being 2 adults and 3 kids (two of 11 and 13 with their own quad and one of 6 together with me). It‚Äôs very safe for kids and the guide was particularly kind (as it‚Äôs the case in almost all situations here in Namibia! :))

So much fun! Friendly staff. We had a wonderful time.

I went to Desert Explorers on my own but was placed in a group of other quad bikers which turned out to be so much fun because they wait for at least 4 people to start the tour. Nice place!

Had a really good time, good service, the guides are friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the quad bike

I don't remember having so much fun and adventure. My soul was at peace. Our camel ride guide and quadbike guide were kind, exciting and seem to really love what they do. Best trip with family so far.

It‚Äôs a great place if you want to explore desert fun‚Äî quad bikes or camel riding in the fine desert sand. You can ride quad bikes without needing to wait but camel rides will require you to wait and you can‚Äôt buy tickets in advance.

Well run organisation.  We did 90 minutes of quad biking and it was an excellent experience with plenty of safety. We went a long way into the desert and the guide made sure we went at a pace that suited us. I would recommend this place thoroughly.
