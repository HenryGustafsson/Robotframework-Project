In a dainty city, lays a treasure titled Kristall Galerie. I‚Äôve been fantasising of visiting this place for eons. ‚Ä¶
---
We drove past this building and it looked interesting.They should have better signs outside to welcome the public.Definitely a must to do in Swakopmund.After the tour we bought some very nice souvenirs for the family and I bought myself a beautiful set of mineral bookends
---
Visited for the second time since 2017 and I was still impressed. This is a really great gallery for showcasing the mineral well if Namibia from the perspective of quality mineral crystals. ‚Ä¶
---
Perfect place to come spend an hour or so looking at nice rocks, although at times it did feel like a jewelry shop for which I paid an entrance fee. I didn't like the fact that the security guard instructed/directed me to go to the gift ‚Ä¶
---
Intresting place to visit with kids while in town.
---
Visit to this exceptional Gallery showcasing the gems and minerals of this part of the world - South West Africa in Swakopmund was amazing though I forgot to obey the rule of not taking photos and was gently reminded by the security peeps!! ‚Ä¶
---
For someone that loves precious stones and wants to learn about them, and perhaps purchase some stones, Kristall Galerie is the perfect destination. The choice is ample, and the exhibits are impressive. They‚Äôve even got a piece of meteorite on display.
---
Wow - what an amazing experience, the gem shops are just exquisite and I particularly enjoyed walking through the Crystal Cave. The renovations and upgrade have transformed this popular tourist attraction.
---
Soooo glad they are open and up and  running again.  They did a few upgrades and it was nice to see. Entrance are not expensive and it's worth the visit.
---
Interesting little crystal museum. Shouldn't have to pay entrance fee, especially when it's mostly a couple of jewelry stores.
---
Pretty cool place to visit while in Swakop. Lots of different crystals and even a replica of a cave. The souvenir shop has an amazing selection for a really cheap price!
---
A beautiful collection of precious stones and gems on display and for sale.

The gallery is quiet and modern and makes for a quaint stop over while touring ‚Ä¶
---
Nice place to visit just beware of the girl at the front desk, she's quite rude, she's acting like there's no POS so no card payments possible and if you haven't got exact money for the tickets she will say she doesn't have change ... also ‚Ä¶
---
A small gallery that was worth visiting. Great displays of crystals and info about the many different types. There is a shop to purchase some if interested. A small admission is charged.
---
This place is quite a gem! (No joke!) It's a nice little crystal (local) history museum but they have jewelers on site that process and make fine jewelry from many other semi precious stones such as citrine, topaz, morganite (one of my ‚Ä¶
---
It‚Äôs cool if your interested in stones and quartz. They have the worlds largest quartz cluster and different kinds of local stones. The staff seems very unenthusiastic.
---
Amazing collection! They had so many beautiful pieces and samples.
---
Amazing gems on display with relevant information.They also have a jewellery shop with beautiful items to purchase The place is well laid out on two levels.Clean bathrooms.On the pricy side,catering for overseas tourists.
---
This is mix between a museum and a (small) jewel/fine stones shopping mall, with a few exhibits on gems and stones found in Namibia and some shops, in a very clean and modern, but quite corporate, setting. The exhibits are interesting, ‚Ä¶
---
Awesome experience. I learned a lot. Well organized and friendly staff. Well worth the visit.
---
Very interesting.Beautiful pieces of jewelry.Should be on everyone's list of one of the places to visit in Swakopmund.Friendly staff.Thoroughly enjoyed the visit.
---
The service is excellent. Please bring a lot of money if you like jewellery because the selection is to die for. The design of the jewellery is out of this world and truely unique. I was not allowed to take photos of it. The displays about ‚Ä¶
---
Beautiful displays of the minerals, but not much reading material explaining the origin of the specimens. Would like to see more geological info...maps perhaps?
---
The most Amazingly beautiful place I have seen in a long time.
---
More like a fee to enter a shop rather than a museum. Guy at the end wouldn't open the exit until I visited the gift shop... 30 NAD to enter
---
I have been meaning to visit the Kristall Gallerie for years. The wait was definitely worth it. The displays are fascinating and informative. Tickets are very inexpensive and the staff very welcoming. I  recommend a visit with my whole heart.
---
What a wonderful experience  most beautiful kristals, art work and jewelry
---
The place is beautiful, especially for people who love rocks (read crystals)
It was about N$20 to enter which is quite fair.
You could get your friend, girlfriend or wife an amazing crystal gift in there ‚Ä¶

---
It was a nice time waster and inexpensive entrance fee
---
We visited with our sons (2 & 4 years old), the gallery was of limited interest to them, but the scratch patch was amazing and kept them busy till closing (I'm sure they would have stayed longer).  The staff were fabulous and they have earned all 5 stars of my review.
---
Excellent collection of crystals and other stones.
The staff is very friendly and helpful.

Variety of crystals to view including biggest quartz in the world. Scratch patch (pick your own bag of stones) available for kids. Interesting facts about the different crystals. Beautiful jewellery and momentoes in the souvenir shop.

If you cannot find the right stones pop into Desert Gems

Pensioners discount.  Great to see all the crystals.

I visited Crystal Gallery last April 11 at 4:00 pm in the afternoon with my family. I was robbed. I paid 200 dollars, while I received the receipt for only 100 dollars. I did not pay attention because I was busy with the children, and of ‚Ä¶

Super interesting place. With a very reasonable 30 Namibian Dollars entrance per person (2023). There are many gemstones to see all displayed buetifully and 3 shops to explore with options for everyone because of the large range in price and products. They even have a meteorite!
---
Largest crystal collection I've had the pleasure of visiting.
---
This is a great place to learn about crystals in Namibia but it also seems like a business to sell them - I would have liked if the gallery and the shop aspect were separated - hard to appreciate the natural stones as a gift from the Earth with the price tag right next to it.
---
Definitely worth a visit if you're interested in Semi precious stones. The different variants are astonishing. Worth a few minutes of your times.
---
Great stones. Good for a quick stop. You can just absorb the beauty of the stones and additionally learn something about them.
Nice shops as well. In every price range. Good for souvenirs.
---
One of the best family outings on the Namibian coastline, of great interest to tourists and locals.
Collection of crystals and natural stone formations are almost to numerous to ‚Ä¶

Very informative and interesting

Well what can I, in my humble opinion say about this exquisite place.
This is probably one of the best galleries I've been to in all of my excursions. ‚Ä¶
---
This was a wonderful and unique experience. The ‚Äòcave tunnel‚Äô was truly magical and searching for our own stones was an exciting time. The shops are not that child friendly which is understandable.

Best cristal display I have ever seen and beautiful jewelry! The Geological Survey  Museum in Windhoek is also wonderful. Was privileged enough to see both.
---
It was ok, lots of gems , crystals and quartz to see, cheap gate fee and you probably spend less than 10mins there. You are allowed to pick up stones and there‚Äôs a replica of the Otjua Mine. ‚Ä¶
---
This is a modern 2 story building with lost of different rocks and minerals on display.  There are shops inside where you can buy different stones by weight, or even expensive gems for your loved one.  If you are looking for your birthstone, you'll find it here.

One of Namibia's greatest tourist attractions is that of gemstones ... my word ... Kristall Galerie gives one the chance to not only explore the different types of gemstones found in the country, but also gives one the opportunity to take ‚Ä¶

Our little school group really had a great time here, facsinating story and very beautiful crystals on display. The staff were very friendly, educational and accommodating especially towards such a young audianc, THANK YOU!
---
Besoek and interesting rocks and crystals. Also a lead up to the jewellery they sell. I really think they could make the tour deal more with the science behind this. How did these form? Why do many in Namibia? Would make it more interesting for the guys.
---
The displays are really beautiful and I loved the information placards detailing the origins of every crystal. I would recommend going through the gift shop as well; the jewellery is worth it.
---
Beautiful! Clean, helpful staff, wonderfully designed jewellery!

Staff in general was very friendly, just not too helpful.
---
What a wonder to view all the beautiful crystals and jewelry.

With one of the Worlds largest Quartz crystals in house Crystal Gallery is a must visit for anyone coming to Swakop. There are a variety of precious stones to buy and artistic creations made from the same precious stones from their gift shop. At only N$20 entrance it is inexcusable to miss.

Exceptional collection

A most fabulous collection and exposition of the minerals and precious stones found in the geology of Namibia. ‚Ä¶

Very neat showcase of local mineralogy and gem exhibits - however the displays are dated and still the same every year. A refresh or new installation would add a new dimension to the exhibits.
---
Beautiful displays of Namibia crystals, which houses the largest crystal mined. Very informative on the different crystals, where they were found, their composition and uses. The affordable entry makes this a  must visit in Swakopmund.
