Very great experience!
Only recently went there for the first time.
The people in charge and staff are super nice. ‚Ä¶
---
We arrived late, and the old man was kind enough to let us in without paying. We just donated a few coins. There are so many interesting things to see, and they are very well maintained. Pass by it you around.
---
Great museum, so much information and hiatory, the kids loved it.
---
3rd time I went to Swakopmund and I finally entered this wonderful museum! It really makes you understand Namibia better. A must do.  The museum itself almost belongsin a museum, but that just adda to the charm and the pioneering spirit of ‚Ä¶
---
This place is amazing!
A must visit
---
We spent over an hour in this museum.  From toy cars, cameras, and printing presses to animals, insects, precious stones, and ox wagons.  Their collection of items is utterly amazing
---
Some great history that can be shared through the generations. Also some great exhibits of nature and geology that make up the the area as well as greater Namibia. ‚Ä¶
---
This museum is a true gem! There is so much to see, from the people of Namibia to animals, skulls, minerals, cameras and much more. I could have spend a few more hours here. The kids liked it as well. Entrance is very cheap.
---
Very well curated and maintained.
Time well spent and cheap entrance.
Lots of super interesting and amazing historical artifacts and objects as well ‚Ä¶
---
This is an incredible museum full of treasures and interesting facts and history.
I would highly recommend taking at least 2 hours to browse through the amazing history and interesting topics. Children and adults can learn alot! Definitely worthwhile
---
A museum which captures the journey of the Namib from precolonial times, their way of life then and the coming of the white settlers late in the 19th century & how it transformed their socio-economic spheres culminating in the modern day Namibia you now know. Pictography & videography depicts the spectre of the journey.
---
Very interesting. The museum itself is it's own museum.
One stop serves all from anthropology over history to technology.
---
One of the finest museums I,ve ever been in. Simply superb
---
Great museum! Lovely collection covering history, nature,... from tge aeta. Must stop.
---
Has excellent collection of minerals, birds eggs, animals, antiques and many others.
---
An awesome museum. Has a great variety of things and is very well maintained. I can highly recommend the experience.
---
Waste of my time as I learned nothing in the museum, I can see it being fun for kids coz of the stuffed animals but no much history about the city's colonial period.
---
Its a nice place to spend some time. There are many good collection of old stuff which you have never seen. You may see revolution of the technology and some skeleton of animals as well. Entrance fee around 10-30 N$. If you are around swakopmund,its worth to visit this museum.
---
A lot of German artifects and history in Namibia exhibited in this museum. Not much of the Namibian people
---
An extensive collection of Namibian artifacts and cultural items. It really helps the visitor to understand the country better. If you are a serious history buff, leave enough time for this activity
---
We really enjoyed this museum. Lots to read, watch, and learn.  Worth spending a good part of your day if you can spare it in between stops.
---
A must pop in experience. Find out more about the different cultures and tribes of the country, see how olden day pharmacy and dental rooms looked, see different modes of transport and antique equipment ranging from cameras to currency to ‚Ä¶
---
Well laid out and interesting.Great place to bring kids but will interest adults as well.Clearly marked out spaces with information well displayed.
---
Lovely museum with lots of interesting things to see. Great for kids too!
---
Insightful museum if you want to learn more about Namibia and Swakopmund, it's inhabitants and animals. I think it's worth a visit.
---
The old dentist office was particularly fascinating but the extensive and diverse displays were well laid out and detailed. We were fortunate to have 2 hours here, and could have stayed another 30 minutes or more. Most people seem to take ‚Ä¶
---
Amazing place, took me and my lovely ü•∞ girlfriend back to history class. ‚Ä¶
---
Very interesting museum full of great displays about the nature & the history of the area, definitely worth a visit.
---
A very interesting exhibit on the Geology of Namibia. One of the exhibitions didn't work properly. Overall I recommend it and it is a very reasonable price.
---
Very good to visit. Fantastic collection and very educational - collection of Namibia's German colonial history, mineral specimens, indigenous fauna and flora
---
If you want to learn about the Namibian history, but also have a look at their wide range of minerals, this is the place to go
---
One place that is well stocked up in terms of information and memorabilia there even have a land rover parked inside the museum. The place is rich in information and artifacts with a lot of history
---
It's an all-round informative museum about everything Namibian. You can learn a lot about the flora, fauna, people, and the geology of the place. You also find interesting facts and see some original items from the colonial era. One can easily spend 2-3 hours here because it's actually bigger than it looks
---
Awesome. Had wonderful experience at the museum! Interesting history facts.
A must see when in swakopmund
---
Very interesting insights of Namibias and especially Swakopmunds history and traditions
---
It was a lovely way to spend an afternoon of leisure with several very interesting bits and bobs.
---
Very interesting little museum explaining not only the history of Namibia but also Namibian Animals, Geology, Martine Life etc. Need at least 2 hours for a proper visit.

Review of Swakopmund Museum:

The Swakopmund Museum is a fascinating institution located in the coastal town ‚Ä¶
---
For a small town very good museum. Found it better than Nairobi and Dar es Salam national museums
---
Great place especially if you like rocks! It's a very cheap bit entertaining activity. Definitely recommended when you are here in Swakop:)
---
Very interesting even more if you have a German background.
---
I recently had the opportunity to explore the museum in Swakopmund, Namibia, on a Saturday afternoon. The entrance fee of Namibian Dollar 30 was quite reasonable. The museum's collection is a delightful mix of historical artifacts and ‚Ä¶
---
It has alot of history,  bummer is no guidance,  we had alot of questions that couldn't be answered

Rich in history! Loved to learn about Swakopmund!

A nice place with good food & friendly Service & fair prices! üëç ‚Ä¶

Kid friendly very cool place to visit

Great place and excellent food

Fascinating! I highly recommend a visit! Well worth N$30pp! Enjoyed it immensely and leaned a lot about Namibia's history

Big variety of history lessons that cater for eveyones taste. Well kept.
---
Great museum with lots to see.
---
A small but interesting museum. With history of the people's of Namibia, some of the animals and insects of the country.  Kids enjoyed the visit.
---
Amazing place

Lots of artifacts and things to look at ‚Ä¶
---
A personal favourite place to visit for me. I love looking at all the exhibits, even though I've already seen them a hundred times. I definitely recommend this place to anyone interested in a small bit of Namibian history, cultural, archaeological and geological. Very interesting.
---
Not very much off namibian history
---
Had a good experience here. Not a very big museum nor has any rare collection, but tells a story and has some historical stuff for sure that can take you back in time. It's very specific to Namibia and Swakopmund so will be interesting. Esp ‚Ä¶
---
Small and compact museum. Not too tiring and you can get briefly overview about Namibia history just 1,5 hours. Stuff was very friendly and polite.
You can pay only cash.
---
It was really cool and fun to look at all the historical things
---
Lots to see, very informative
---
Sights from around Swakopmund
---
Very awesome place loved it so much to see and learn
Lol only have 1 pic on this phone
---
Cooked food using really old oil and didn't care much for it. Waitresses also just aren't attentive. Worst restauranting experience I've had in year. Their best feature is the museum and the beach view.
---
A really interesting museum with an array of artifacts depicting Namibian history, geography, geology, animal life and much more.
We stayed much longer at the museum as initally intended as it was so ‚Ä¶
---
One could seriously learn a lot about Namibian nature, history, and pre colonial era from this museum. It‚Äôs almost the whole world in a building, and their facts are straight and well matched.
---
Very interesting Museum with clever displays!
---
We sat down for a beer or 2 while the children played in the playground, service was friendly, just a little slow but it's understandable as it was a busy long weekend. Price's are a little steep but then you have to take in account the ‚Ä¶

Found much more than expected and ended up spending hours going through it all! The retelling of Namibia's and Swakopmund's history is biased in presentation though (for example, the Herrero Uprisings are mentioned, but the subsequent ‚Ä¶
---
Full of historical artefacts , including from pre-colonial to military and natural history. I couldn't take it all in! Rooms featuring early twentieth century dentistry and pharmacy...massive collection of crystals..interesting timeline of Swakopmund history with photos,,,highly recommended
---
If you have some time to kill, definitely plan to visit this museum. It's got a little bit of everything in there, and very educational for the kids. Small entrance fee, and clean premises. What a welcome surprise!
---
Fun place to see loads of history but was not very impressed by the  indigenous history. I could not help but feel there was still a lot missing... But otherwise it was nice and pictures are allowed  and it only costs 30 namibian dollars.
---
Excellent small 'folk' museum with everything relevant to the specific heritage of Swakopmund and the wider history of Namibia. Tiny entrance price of N$30. Requires 2-3 hours to absorb most displays.
---
A very upsetting experience of the German influence on the beautiful country of Namibia. The glorification of war was sickening and the exclusion of the vile annihilation of the Indigenous people was only to be expected.
Not impressed!
---
Incredible place to learn about my heritage and history. Surprisingly Nostalgic.  Profound discoveries, rare displays &  so many things to learn about. Definitely returning when I get the chance.
---
Worth visiting, with a wide range of items on show from crystals to cameras , archeology to apothecary. Although slightly time-worn, it provides a good insight into the diversity of Namibian history, geology, peoples and natursl diversity.
---
Really nice museum. This place has a large collection of model cars, steam machines and explains the history of Namibia with wall panels, models and pictures. This place is really worth a visit if you are staying in the area
---
Nice museum with interesting facts about local history.
---
very nice museum, interesting displays about history of Swakopmund and Namibia, the museum is quite big, takes up two floors, ticket price was N$30, there is also a souvenir shop inside
---
Perhaps the best museum in Namibia which was originally a private collection. Set aside a couple of hours at the very least to explore this rich collection. Moreover a bus Rossing Uranium mine bus excursion can be booked through museum and departs from museum parking area.
---
Excellent museam, full of interesting exhibits and facts about Swakopmund and Namibia in general. This was great value for money and worth every cent spent. By far this is the very best museum that I've seen in the whole of Namibia. This was well worth the visit.
---
Amazing museum! Admission is only 1 dollar (USD).
---
We went to the Swapkopmund museum with the intention of actually learning something about the history of this town.
As we had previously learned about the colonial history of Namibia and the ‚Ä¶
---
Very impressed with the different displays. As a Namibian, it really means so much to have our history preserved so well.
---
Surprisingly good, varied displays in both time and subject. Everything from a dentists room and apothecary through printing equipment, local people, rocks, toy cars to stuffed animals.
---
Worth the small amount of money. So much to see I will highly recommend it, and don't be in a hurry.
---
Best place to visit in swakopmund,  very friendly staff and all information in side very useful..
---
Museum is good! The collection is what you want to see (and touch!) You may also find some nice cafes nearby. Palm Beach is just 50 meters away!
---
Has not changed much in the last few years, since I last visited. Really cool to revisit all the old scenarios(shout out to the old timey pharmacy). Would definitely go again.
---
The museum is fabulous and the staff exceptional but the cafe on the corner has shocking service with inept, arrogant owners/ manageress. You can't complain about the service as there was none.
---
Best museum in namibia
---
A great collection of  items: plants, animals, minerals, stones, art, history of the place, fossils, technology. A great option for the unpredictable Swakopmund weather. Photography is allowed if you pay an extra amount.
---
People friendly. All the history which we learned at school... Was nice to see it for myself. Everything kept in good condition and looked after. Nice couple of restaurant next to it
---
Excellent place to learn about Namibian history and culture, different ethnic groups, the environment and animal diversity.
---
What a fantastic museum! Very informative and very good displays. Well worth the visit if you like history!
---
This is a small but beautiful museum. If you are interested in the history of Swakopmund this should be your first stop. The museum contains a treasure trove of orginal Swakopmund artifacts and we visit it every time we go to Swakopmund. My ‚Ä¶
---
Unfortunately the museum was closed for renovations when we got there in July 2024..
---
Friendly staff, great atmosphere and exhibitions interesting. A bit pricey, but understandable as they are open almost 24/7
---
Beautiful museum with great and very broad information about the history of Swakopmund and Namibia and the people living there. A great way to learn more about this amazing country!
---
Display on point.
I would recommend a guide when one has to walk through the museum, because half the time we were clueless about why a certain thing was there or what it meant.

Gypsy Journey  _ roadtrip to Namibia and Botswana _ new adventures  _  on the road to nowhere on whatever day _ making memories _ one campsite at a time _ Swakopmund _ Museum

It was gratefully to find this historical things in the museum.

It has quite a collection.

A good place to spend some time. Relive the old times and show your kids some of the old equipment and tools. Good to see al the animals up close.

It's a must see and quite special.  I just wish it was kept in a better condition including the office and toilets where you enter. Otherwise a definite must see
