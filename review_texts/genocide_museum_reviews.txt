Laidlaw shared his knowledge about the genocides and with his work he is trying to bring awareness about it to the world.
Very informative place. A must place to visit when in Swakopmund.

This is probably one of the most important museums in Namibia (and probably the tiniest). Touching, informative and well curated. Our guide Ningiree was very knowledgable and gave us a fantastic talk about the untold and gruesome history of Swakopmund and Namibia.

Laidlaw, the museum owner, shared extensive information about the genocide and answered all of our questions. It was an experience that deepened our understanding of Namibia's culture and history. ‚Ä¶

This was one of the best experiences we had in Swakopmund. It was an emotional and deep lesson about the atrocities committed against the indigenous people of Namibia, by a man who is doing it not for profit, but to educate people. We ‚Ä¶

A very informative museum. The work the association is doing is important to bring more awareness to this often unknown part of German history - the genocide on the Herero committed by Germans.

Incredible museum run by brave and important activists - filling in a gap in our education and learning on Namibia. ‚Ä¶

A must see place with interesting insights in the namibian history, colonial history, German history and challenges of historical science nowadays. Facts with emotional stories, photos in a small room, and a passionated guide who can answer ‚Ä¶

Very interesting and important museum! Thank you Laidlaw Peringanda for your time with us.

Very important work is done here, to remember what happened to the Herero and Nama during German colonial times. Visit this place and learn about the Genocide, so it gets more attention. Must see in Svakopmund!

The Swakopmund Genocide Museum is an eye-opening experience. Laidlaw, the knowledgeable curator, patiently answered all our questions, making the visit informative and engaging. This small but important museum deserves more recognition. A ‚Ä¶

Very small museum but very big in History, you have to go there to find out the truth about Namibia. You have to call for a appointment.
---
Valuable museum led by an inspiring and dedicated director that shared with us the history of the genocide. A must do while in town.
---
A must visit if you're in Swakopmund. Laidlaw is working hard to show the world a part of Namibia's history that certain colonialist and powerful entities want to remain hidden or erased. ‚Ä¶

A very important place, where you can hear the black story about the killing of more than 40.000 Herero and Nama people and how this still effects the lives of people today.....

Worth a visit. I was born in Namibia but grew up in Australia so I didn‚Äôt have a lot of education surrounding this. It was amazing that I had all the information told and was asked if I had any questions. Definitely recommend!

Very informative, and very moving. Like with all history, it is important to reflect upon it and learn from it, not cover it up.
Laidlaw did a great job of showing the atrocities committed by German ‚Ä¶

Informative and horrifying. The museum founder personally walks you through his and others'research of the genocide, concentration camps and mass graves as well as the history of Namibia. I can't recommend strongly enough that everyone who visits Swakopmund visit this museum.

Highly recommended. Very informative and important work.
Especially as a German tourist you should visit this place to learn more about the sad and horrific past.

It is the best amazing Genocide museum one would find in Swakop and around Erongo region with perfect lecturer and also offering online classes as well.

Incredible! A very small memorial museum, Laidlaw runs it himself. It seems a little uncoordinated at first, which gives you all the more time to let the images you see take effect. We were very impressed with how openly Laidlaw spoke to us ‚Ä¶

This museum describes the genocide of over 100,000 Ovaherero and Nama by German soldiers. The history presented here was researched and compiled with self-sacrificing work by the museum director Laidlaw Peringanda and his colleagues. ‚Ä¶
