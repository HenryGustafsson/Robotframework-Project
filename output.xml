From toy cars, cameras, and printing presses to animals, insects, precious stones, and ox wagons.  Their collection of items is utterly amazing\\n---\\nSome great history that can be shared through the generations. Also some great exhibits of nature and geology that make up the the area as well as greater Namibia. \\u2026\\n---\\nThis museum is a true gem!

Definitely worthwhile\\n---\\nA museum which captures the journey of the Namib from precolonial times, their way of life then and the coming of the white settlers late in the 19th century &amp; how it transformed their socio-economic spheres culminating in the modern day Namibia you now know.

If you are around swakopmund,its worth to visit this museum.\\n---\\nA lot of German artifects and history in Namibia exhibited in this museum. Not much of the Namibian people\\n---\\nAn extensive collection of Namibian artifacts and cultural items. It really helps the visitor to understand the country better.

Great for kids too!\\n---\\nInsightful museum if you want to learn more about Namibia and Swakopmund, it\'s inhabitants and animals.

We were fortunate to have 2 hours here, and could have stayed another 30 minutes or more. Most people seem to take \\u2026\\n---\\nAmazing place, took me and my lovely \\ud83e\\udd70 girlfriend back to history class. \\u2026\\n---\\nVery interesting museum full of great displays about the nature &amp; the history of the area, definitely worth a visit.\\n---\\nA very interesting exhibit on the Geology of Namibia.

The place is rich in information and artifacts with a lot of history\\n---\\nIt\'s an all-round informative museum about everything Namibian. You can learn a lot about the flora, fauna, people, and the geology of the place. You also find interesting facts and see some original items from the colonial era. One can easily spend 2-3 hours here because it\'s actually bigger than it looks\\n---\\nAwesome. Had wonderful experience at the museum! Interesting history facts.\\nA must see when in swakopmund\\n---\\nVery interesting insights of Namibias and especially Swakopmunds history and traditions\\n---\\nIt was a lovely way to spend an afternoon of leisure with several very interesting bits and bobs.\\n---\\nVery interesting little museum explaining not only the history of Namibia but also Namibian Animals, Geology, Martine Life etc. Need at least 2 hours for a proper visit.\\n---\\nReview of Swakopmund Museum:\\n\\nThe Swakopmund Museum is a fascinating institution located in the coastal town \\u2026\\n---\\nFor a small town very good museum.

Definitely recommended when you are here in Swakop:)\\n---\\nVery interesting even more if you have a German background.\\n---\\nI recently had the opportunity to explore the museum in Swakopmund, Namibia, on a Saturday afternoon. The entrance fee of Namibian Dollar 30 was quite reasonable. The museum\'s collection is a delightful mix of historical artifacts and \\u2026\\n---\\nIt has alot of history,  bummer is no guidance,  we had alot of questions that couldn\'t be answered\\n---\\nRich in history!

I definitely recommend this place to anyone interested in a small bit of Namibian history, cultural, archaeological and geological. Very interesting.\\n---\\nNot very much off namibian history\\n---\\nHad a good experience here. Not a very big museum nor has any rare collection, but tells a story and has some historical stuff for sure that can take you back in time. It\'s very specific to Namibia and Swakopmund so will be interesting. Esp \\u2026\\n---\\nSmall and compact museum.

Their best feature is the museum and the beach view.\\n---\\nA really interesting museum with an array of artifacts depicting Namibian history, geography, geology, animal life and much more.\\nWe stayed much longer at the museum as initally intended as it was so \\u2026\\n---\\nOne could seriously learn a lot about Namibian nature, history, and pre colonial era from this museum.
